    <p class="blocktext">This is an example of a data visualization that I love because it is both graphical representation of data and a physical, interactive object. The artist, Paul May, writes that "Data from the New York Times was pulled into custom software, which calculated the size of each card, and rendered its shape precisely. Shape files were sent to a laser cutter, producing individual cards. The cards were then stacked on a vertical rail."</p>
