    <p class="blocktext">I am a Master of City Planning candidate at MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning. This website will display the data visualizations that I am making in the spring 2017 class, Big Data Visualization.</p>
    <p class="blocktext">Before coming to MIT, I worked for an urban agriculture pilot project in Nicaragua, as an environmental educator in Maine, Massachusetts, and Baltimore, and at an energy efficiency consulting firm in Vermont. My background in installation art and sculpture from my undergraduate degree has influenced my past projects, as well as my current work in urban design and graphical representation. Check out my online portfolio <a href="http://www.danyafrench.com">here.</a></p>

    <p class="blocktext">This is an example of a data visualization that I love because it is both graphical representation of data and a physical, interactive object. The artist, Paul May, writes that "data from the New York Times was pulled into custom software, which calculated the size of each card, and rendered its shape precisely. Shape files were sent to a laser cutter, producing individual cards. The cards were then stacked on a vertical rail."</p>
